## Audio File Structure

The SD card file system must follow this structure:

```
/01/  # Departure melodies
/02/  # ATOS announcements
/03/  # Door chime sounds
/04/  # Platform announcements
```
 - SD File system can be downloaded here: https://github.com/99buntai/JR-BERU-ESP/releases/download/R0.3.7R2.0.5/SD-files-241225.zip

## Setup Instructions

1. Format the SD card as FAT32.
2. Copy audio files to the appropriate folders.
3. Connect hardware according to the [Pin Configuration](#pin-configuration).
4. Flash firmware to the ESP32 using the Arduino IDE.
5. Power on the device.
6. Connect to the "JR-BERU-AP" WiFi network.
7. Configure your WiFi settings via the web interface.
8. Access the web interface at the device's assigned IP address.

## Configuration Files

### Station Configuration

The station configuration file is a JSON file that defines lines, stations, and tracks for the system. The structure includes:

- **lines**: Available JRlines (JY, JR, etc.)
  - **style**: Visual styling for the station sign elements (colors)
  - **stations**: List of stations on the selected line
    - **stationInfo**: Details about the station (names, codes)
    - **tracks**: Different track configurations 
      - **lineMarker**: Line and station number
      - **audio**: Audio file mappings
      - **direction**: Previous and next stations

You can use the included station config editor to create or modify configuration files.
